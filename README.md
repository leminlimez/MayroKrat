# Mayro Krat
PyGame remake of Super Mario Kart. I made this for the final project of my CS class, which required a game to be made in PyGame. The assignment was unfortunately canceled due to my school being hacked right before finals, but I am still posting it here because I worked hard on it and it was a great learning experience.

Currently only has Time Trial mode and only keyboard support.

# How to Run
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install the required modules: [PyGame,](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) [Numpy,](https://numpy.org/install) and [Numba.](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/installing.html)
3. Open and run `Main.py` in Idle. This will take around 10 seconds to compile upon running each time.

This project is quite unoptimized and some modules are quite messy.

# Controls
This only supports keyboard. I may add controller support later if I decide to continue on the project.

W - `Accelerate`

S - `Decelerate`

A - `Turn Left`

D - `Turn Right`


Left Shift - Tap to `hop`, Hold to `drift`

Space - `Use Item`
